1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,908
We will create a non-measurable subset on S1

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,965
we will use the notation p in brackets

3
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,708
to mean the equivalence class of p

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,696
Now, we can do this for all points, so

5
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:28,876
that we have a collection of all equivalence classes.

6
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:33,695
Using the Axiom of Choice, we can pick exactly one point from

7
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:39,513
each of these equivalence classes. This will be our non-measurable set M.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,818
Notice now that we can form the whole circle

9
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,364
again by looking at all rational rotations of M

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,116
By sigma additivity, we then get the following

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,788
So then, what is mu of M?

12
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,892
If we take mu of M is zero, then the

13
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:04,798
measure of the unit circle must also be zero.

14
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:07,697
But if we take mu of M to be nonzero,

15
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,894
then the measure of the unit circle must be infinite!

16
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:16,489
It should be clear that neither of these options is a good choice.
