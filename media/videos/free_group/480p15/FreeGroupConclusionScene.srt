1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,172
So what we can conclude from all the trees is the following.

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:08,467
If we multiply all elements in F2 starting with sigma

3
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:11,957
by sigma inverse on the left, we get all of

4
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:17,150
the free group, except the elements starting with sigma inverse.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,903
This is of course equivalent to saying that F2 is the

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:26,436
union of sigma inverse W sigma and W sigma inverse

7
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:31,802
But the choice for sigma was arbitrary, we could have just as

8
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:36,601
well chosen to looked at the subtree of elements starting with tau.

9
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,232
So we also have that F2 is the union

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:44,102
of tau inverse W tau and W tau inverse

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,876
Let's look at the original partition of F2 that we made.

12
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,844
Notice that the parts in the original partition are now disjointly

13
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:57,641
used in the two new partitions that we have found.

14
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:02,485
So what we have now is called a paradoxical decomposition. We

15
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:06,861
have split the free group F2 into five parts, took four

16
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,759
of them and sort of shifted two of those parts to

17
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,089
create two copies of F2. This is called a paradoxical decomposition
