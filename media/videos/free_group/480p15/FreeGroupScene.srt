00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,708
One of the essential constructions in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox

2
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:09,989
is the use of the free group to “duplicate” the ball. We

3
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:14,651
will see that the free group generated by two elements can be

4
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:19,696
easily divided into parts, such that they can be shifted to create

5
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:24,511
two copies of itself. This is in essence what we wil eventually

6
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:28,868
be doing with the unit sphere. So what is the free group?

7
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:32,717
Let's look at a definition. The free group f two

8
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:36,926
generated by two elements sigma and tau is the group

9
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:41,539
consisting of all finite products of sigma, tau and their

10
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:46,233
inverses. The identity in this group is the empty product.

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,113
These are some examples of elements.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,112
One way to look at this group is to consider it as

13
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:59,364
a directed tree. At the root of the tree, we have the

14
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:04,098
identity element e. We can then go further down the tree by

15
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,796
multiplying on the right with sigma, sigma inverse, tau or tau inverse.

16
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:13,818
Each step down the tree is a multiplication on the right

17
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:17,435
by some element of F2. Note that we only looked at

18
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,993
the progression of the tree for words starting with sigma, then

19
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:27,346
starting with sigma tau. You should imagine the tree continuing infinitely

20
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,878
for all the other branches as well.

21
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,529
We can represent the same thing symbolically

22
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,217
as follows. F2 can be written as

23
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:41,084
the disjoint union of the empty word, all the elements starting

24
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:46,939
with sigma, the elements starting with sigma inverse, the elements starting

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,998
with tau, and the elements starting with tau inverse

26
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,465
Now let's take a closer look at the

27
00:01:53,565 --> 00:01:56,678
branch that has elements starting with sigma.

28
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:03,870
Notice that when, for all these elements, we multiply on the

29
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,038
left by sigma inverse, we get the whole tree again!
