00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,724
One of the essential constructions in the proof of the Banach-Tarski paradox

2
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:10,016
is the use of the free group to “duplicate” the ball. We

3
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:14,692
will see that the free group generated by two elements can be

4
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:19,750
easily divided into parts, such that they can be shifted to create

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,579
two copies of itself. This is in essence what we wil eventually

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,028
be doing with the unit sphere. So what is it?

7
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:31,901
Let's look at a definition. The free group f two

8
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,109
generated by two elements sigma and tau is the group

9
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:40,722
consisting of all finite products of sigma, tau and their

10
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:45,416
inverses. The identity in this group is the empty product.

11
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:48,296
These are some examples of elements.

12
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:52,390
One way to look at this group is to consider it as

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,744
a directed tree. At the root of the tree, we have the

14
00:00:56,844 --> 00:01:01,590
identity element e. We can then go further down the tree by

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,355
multiplying with sigma, sigma inverse, tau or tau inverse.
